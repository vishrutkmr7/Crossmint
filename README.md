## Setting Up Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information, such as the candidate ID, to demonstrate adherence to security best practices.

### Using the Provided `test.env` for Demonstration

For ease of demonstration, a `test.env` file has been included in this repository. This file contains a placeholder for the `CANDIDATE_ID` environment variable. Please note, the `test.env` file is included in the repository explicitly for review purposes to illustrate the setup. In a real-world scenario, `.env` files should not be committed to version control to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information.
